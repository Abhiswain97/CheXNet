# CheXNet

This is part of my internship at Endimension Technology, IIT Bombay.

PyTorch implementation of [CheXNet: Radiologist level pneumonia detection using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05225)
based on [this](https://github.com/arnoweng/CheXNet) implementation.

You can run the complete notebook on Kaggle -> [CheXNet-PyTorch](https://www.kaggle.com/abhiswain/chexnet-pytorch)
